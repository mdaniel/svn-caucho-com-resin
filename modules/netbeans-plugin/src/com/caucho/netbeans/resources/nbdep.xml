  The container-limitation element modifies a plugin to say that not all j2ee deployments are valid.
  For example, a web-only server would include
  <container-limitation> <war-deploy/> </container-limitation>
  to indicate that only war deployments are accepted.
  If a container-limitation element is not present, all j2ee deployments are assumed valid.
  If a container-limitation element is present, then only j2ee deployment types explicitly
  mentioned are allowed.
