      <p>
        Resin will keep its operational data in a directory named<i>
        resin-data</i>.

        By default directory
        <i>resin-data</i>
        is located under Resin Root.

      </p>

      <p>
        For each server in cluster Resin creates a dedicated directory where
        operational data for that server is stored:
        e.g.<i>resin-data/app-0</i>,
        <i>resin-data/app-1</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Operational data for an individual server include two important
        directories:

        <br/>
        <br/>A directory for deployed applications named
        <i>.git</i>
        <br/>A directory for sessions and distributed cache named
        <i>distcache</i>

        <br/>
        <br/>

        Deleting .git directory will result in all deployed applications be
        deleted from the server.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Deleting directory
        <i>distcache</i>
        will result in session data being
        deleted.
