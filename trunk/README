II) Preconditions
-----------------

  1) Resin needs a Java JDK before it can run.  Resin 4.0 works with 
     JDK 1.6 or greater.

     Some locations for JDKs include:

     Oracle:
       http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

  2) On Windows, you'll need an unzip tool available at http://www.winzip.com
 
  3) A HTML 5 browser is needed for some features of the /resin-admin tool.

III) Getting Started
--------------------

The included HTTP/1.1 server makes it easy to evaluate Resin, JSP
and servlets.  Just start it up.  The default configuration
file is found in resin-4.0.x/conf/resin.xml.

  1) On Unix, you'll want to build the JNI libraries:

     resin-4.0.x> ./configure --prefix=`pwd`
     resin-4.0.x> make
     resin-4.0.x> make install

  2) To start the server:

       unix> bin/resin.sh start

     or

       C:\> java -jar lib/resin.jar start

     The server listens to port 8080.  Port 8080 is the default specified
     in the configuration file resin-4.0.x/conf/resin.xml

     Log files are in resin-4.0.x/log

  3) Usually, Resin can find the JDK, but you may need to set JAVA_HOME in some
     configurations. 

     Starting Resin with -verbose is a great way to see what environment
     Resin is running.

  4) Browse http://localhost:8080 or equivalently http://127.0.0.1:8080.

  5) Go through the documentation at http://localhost:8080/resin-doc


IV) Application Deployment
--------------------------

  1) You can use the command-line to deploy a .war file:
  
       unix> bin/resin.sh deploy foo.war

  2) You can also copy the war file to the webapps directory.

     To deploy a war file, place the file in resin-4.0.x/webapps/foo.war
     Resin will expand the war file, and the application will be available
     with the url http://localhost:8080/foo/

  3) Resin supports the development of applications without requiring a war
     file deployment.  Create a directory resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar to
     correspond to url http://localhost:8080/bar/.  Java source files
     placed in resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/classes/ are automatically 
     compiled by Resin.

     resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/index.jsp
       --> http://localhost:8080/bar/
       --> http://localhost:8080/bar/index.jsp

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/web.xml
       -- servlet/jsp configuration file

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/resin-web.xml
       -- Resin specific configuration

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/classes/example/HelloServlet.java
       -- java source file, automatically compiled by Resin
     
  4) For PHP, create test.php in resin-4.0.x/webapps/ROOT/test.php and browse
     http://localhost:8080/test.php.


IV) PDF Reports
---------------

  With Resin-Pro, you can get a PDF snapshot report of the server with the
  command-line:

    unix> bin/resin.sh pdf-report

  You can also get a watchdog restart report with the -watchdog option
  
    unix> bin/resin.sh pdf-report -watchdog

    
V) /resin-admin browser-based administration
--------------------------------------------

  An administration application is available at

     http://localhost:8080/resin-admin

  Instructions are provided for setting a password.
