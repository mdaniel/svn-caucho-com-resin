/**
 * The @QueryGet annotation marks a SimpleBamService method as handling
 * a GET RPC query.  GET calls must not modify any state in the service,
 * because SET calls are responsible for modifying state.  Queries
 * are matched to results using a long id, which is unique for each
 * query in the connection.  GET queries must send either a queryResult
 * or a queryError to the caller, because the client may be blocking
 * waiting for a reply.
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * @QueryGet
 * boolean queryGet(long id, String to, String from, MyGetQuery value)
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * A ping RPC query handler would look like:
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * @QueryGet
 * public boolean pingQuery(long id, String to, String from, PingQuery value)
 * {
 *   getBrokerStream().queryResult(id, from, to, value);
 *
 *   return true;
 * }
 * </pre></code>
