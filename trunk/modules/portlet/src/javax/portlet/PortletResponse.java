   * Encode a url to a resource.
   *
   * The <code>path</code> may be an absolute URL ("http://myserver/...")
   * or a URI with a full path ("/myapp/mypath/....").
   *
   * <code>path</code> may also be a relative path ("images/myimage.gif"), in
   * which case it is a url to a resource in the current "portal", typically a
   * path relative to the current webapp.  Allowing a relative path is an
   * extension of the behaviour defined by the portlet specification.
   *
   * The returned URL is always an absolute url.  Some browsers do not
   * understand relative url's supplied for certain parameters (such as the
   * location of css files).
