/**
 * A forgiving HTML parser interface.
 *
 * <p>The forgiving HTML parser is useful for extracting information from
 * the web since many sites have not-quite-standard HTML.
 *
 * <p>To parse a file into a DOM Document use
 * <pre><code>
 * Document doc = new Html().parseDocument("foo.html");
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>To parse a string into a DOM Document use
 * <pre><code>
 * String html = "&lt;h1>small test&lt;/h1>";
 * Document doc = new Html().parseDocumentString(html);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>To parse a file using the SAX API use
 * <pre><code>
 * Html html = new Html();
 * html.setContentHandler(myContentHandler);
 * html.parse("foo.html");
 * </code></pre>
