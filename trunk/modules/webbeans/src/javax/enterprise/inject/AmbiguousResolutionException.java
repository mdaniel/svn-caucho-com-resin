/**
 * When an injection {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager#getInstance
 * Manager.getInstance} call cannot return a unique bean, it throws
 * this exception.
 *
 * This ambiguity may occur when two subtypes match, e.g. <code>BeanA</code>
 * and <code>BeanB</code> both implementing <code>@Current BeanAPI</code>.
 *
 * The ambiguity may also occur when using more than
 * one {@link javax.enterprise.inject.BindingType @BindingType} on the same
 * bean or when using the special {@link javax.enterprise.inject.Any @Any}
 * bindings, for example:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * @Foo @A public class Bean {}
 * @Foo @B public class Bean {}
 *
 * class MyClass {
 *   @Foo Bean _fooField
 *   @Any Bean _anyField
 * }
 * </code></pre>
